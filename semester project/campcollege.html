				<h2>RISING SENIORS</h2>
				<p>
					There’s nothing quite like spending time on a college campus to jump start your plans for life after high school. For rising seniors, our Camp College initiative provides insight, guidance, support, and information for students and their families. Camp College starts with a planning retreat on the beautiful Sewanee: The University of the South campus in mid-June.  Admissions officers and college advisors from across the southeast work with students in small groups and one-on-one to cover all aspects of the college application and financial aid processes.

				<h2>PROGRAM DETAILS</h2>
				<p>
					Sessions include scholarship essay writing, college searches, and a mini-college fair, as well as opportunities to meet other students and preview campus life. Parents/guardians of accepted students will be invited to attend a financial aid workshop and orientation in late May and early June.<br><br>

					Students and volunteer group leaders will be housed in a dorm on Sewanee’s campus, just 45 minutes from Chattanooga. Transportation, rooms, meals, and materials are all paid by PEF, Sewanee, and other generous sponsors. For accepted students, there will be a $25 non-refundable enrollment fee.<br><br>

					Camp College will host up to 75 rising seniors who meet the following criteria:<br><br>
					<ul class = "ul-list-style margin-bottom padding-bottom">
						<li class = "li-list-style padding-bottom">Be on track to graduate in 2023;</li>
						<li class = "li-list-style padding-bottom">Have a grade point average of 2.5 or higher; and</li>
						<li class = "li-list-style padding-bottom">Have financial need and/or be the first in your family to attend college.</li>

				<h2>RISING JUNIORS</h2>
				<p>
					It’s never too early for students to consider their post-high school plans.  In 2021, PEF added an introductory component called Camp College for Rising Juniors.  The 1-day planning retreat will be hosted on the campus of Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) and serves as an opportunity for rising juniors to get ahead of the journey by learning from experts and each other about making a smooth transition from high school to college. Students work in small groups to discuss topics including mock admissions, financing college, best college fit, business expectations, and a campus tour.
