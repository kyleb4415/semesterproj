						<br>
						Building on the success of an initial investment in the Fall of 2017 that supported Chattanooga 2.0’s eighth urgent strategy “Prepare All Students for College and Career,” Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation invited Chattanooga to apply to be part of a new P-16 initiative. The P-16 Framework ensures all students, especially those from low income communities and students of color have access to educational opportunities from Pre-K through postsecondary.<br><br>

						One aspect of the P-16 initiative is to increase the number of students who graduate from our seven high schools (Brainerd, Central, East Ridge, Hixson, Howard, Red Bank, and Tyner) enroll and then complete a college degree or a credential with value in our economy.<br><br>
					
						In partnership with Hamilton County Schools, University of Tennessee at Chattanooga (UTC), Chattanooga State Community College, East Tennessee State University, and Lane College we created the Gateway Scholars program.<br></p>
